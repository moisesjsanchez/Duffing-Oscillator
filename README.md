## Duffing Oscillator 

This was small analysis was done to check type of first order solver was best for solving a chaotic ODE. Attached is also a solver for a Duffing Oscillator written using Euler's method. The solver outputs a table, and various graphs for both physical and mathematical analysis. Attached are a brief explanation of the Duffing Oscillator, and the process of selecting of the best first order method for chaotic ODE.
