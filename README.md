# Numerical-Analysis
Here is some general ODE solvers that I coded using Python. All of the following ODE solvers solve for the exact solution (assuming it is known), approx. solution, abs error, and time needed to run.
Disclaimer: packages needed to run the code are numpy, astropy, and matplotlib.
